## The game

Under the Counter is a simulation game in which you impersonate a bartender trying to stay afloat and undercover as the prohibition era begins.

You play as the owner of a bustling bar in a 20's retro-inspired city called Korgis. You will have to manage the sale of alcoholic beverages as prohibition sets in, trying to maximize your revenue while keeping the illegal operation hidden from the authorities.
